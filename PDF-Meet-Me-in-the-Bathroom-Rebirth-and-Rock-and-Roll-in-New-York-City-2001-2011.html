Our Band Could Be Your Life, and Can?t Stop Won?t Stop, an intriguing oral history of the post-9/11 decline of the old-guard music industry and rebirth of the New York rock scene, led by a group of iconoclastic rock bands.In the second half of the twentieth-century New York was the source of new sounds, including the Greenwich Village folk scene, punk and new wave, and hip-hop. But as the end of the millennium neared, cutting-edge bands began emerging from Seattle, Austin, and London, pushing New York further from the epicenter. The behemoth music industry, too, found itself in free fall, under siege from technology. Then 9/11/2001 plunged the country into a state of uncertainty and war?and a dozen New York City bands that had been honing their sound and style in relative obscurity suddenly became symbols of glamour for a young, web-savvy, forward-looking generation in need of an anthem.Meet Me in the Bathroom charts the </div><h3><span style="color: #ff0000;">Book Details</span></h3><div style="font-size: 13.3333px;"><p>Author : Lizzy Goodman</p><p>Pages : 640 pages</p><p>Publisher : Dey Street Books</p><p>Language : </p><p>ISBN-10 : 0062233106</p><p>ISBN-13 : 9780062233103</p></div>
